PROJECT: 3D PRINTING

## IMPLEMENTED SO FAR:
- Code foundation
- Greedy Construction

## HOW TO USE:
From pwd: `src/`
```bash 
python base.py --log-level debug --input-file '../data/3d-printing/sample.txt' --csearch greedy
```
```bash 
python base.py --input-file '../data/3d-printing/sample.txt' --csearch greedy
```

## PROJECT INFORMATION

This repository contains all relevant files for the SIGEVO Summer
School 2024 modelling projects. It is organized as follows:

- In the `documents` folder you can find the slides of the "Constructive
  search" and "Local search" presentations given during the summer school,
  and the project statement, which includes the description of the
  problems and the modelling API documentation.
- In the `src` folder you can find all the code, including the API
  code, a simple TSP example model, and several evaluators to validate
  solutions obtained for the problems.
- In the `data` folder you can find some problem instances that you
  can use to test the models.
